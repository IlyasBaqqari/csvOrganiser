Write a program that reads the contents of a CSV file, input.csv, and sorts it contents by name and age. The program should be launched using two arguements, 'input.csv' and 'output.csv'. The result of the program should be a file that contains the sorted contents in correct csv formatting.

Try and think about everything we covered yesterday, what features of the language or object orientated programming in general can help you towards this goal?
Feel free to research things on Google or ask me and Dylan any questions if you get stuck. 

Including comments and well formatted code is a must! So make use of InteliJ's auto formatting feature.

If you feel like you have a working solution, send me a message and I'm sure I'll find a way to break it and if I can't I'll suggest some further features you can add!
